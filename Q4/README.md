# Question 4 Analysis

## Sum/Clear Pairs

This section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2D Arrays):

### My initial approach during the exam:

I forgot how to do the game of life code so i tried different if statements

### My revised solution after review:

It contains fixed logical errors, the loops are better name than what I had on the test for readability
Removing unecessary check of true and false statements.

### Key concepts tested in this question:

* **Understanding of rows and columns**
* 2D arrays sytanx
* Conditional statements
* loop through a 2D arrays

### What I learned from revisiting this problem:

* Instead of nested if statements, you can use || (or) && (and) to shorten it
