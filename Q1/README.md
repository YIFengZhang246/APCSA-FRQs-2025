This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures)

**My initial approach**
I initially use if, else statements to comepelete the question

**My revised solution after review**
My revised solution is simpler, use Math.min() Thought in the context of the question with comparsion why not focusing on if statement

**Key concepts tested**
Boolean statement
If statement
Math class's
Logically comparsions
**What I learned**
Perception
Simplifying code
