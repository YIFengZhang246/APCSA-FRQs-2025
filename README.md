# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solution written by **Yi Feng Zhang***

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science A exam taken on May 7th 2025. While reviewing the released questions, I found new solutions for certain questions, and fix some mistake I made during the exam itself.

## Preparation

In this section I would describe what I did during the last few days toward the AP exam

* Watching a course review video
* Reading csAwesome
* Reviewing ArrayList
* Reviewing 2D Array

## Exam Experiences

In this section, I will reflect on my feelings and thoughts throughout the exam

* My preparation strategy for the exam included...
Practicing multiple-choice and free-response questions, reviewing notes, and using past exams.

* The most challenging aspects of the exam were...
Multi-part free-response questions and applying multiple concepts at once.

* Time management techniques that worked well for me...
Pacing myself, skipping hard questions to return later, and tracking time per section.

* Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions...
Staying calm, breaking the problem down, and looking for familiar patterns.

Growth Opportunities
Improve speed and confidence with tricky topics like recursion and object-oriented design.

## Growth Opportunites

Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

* ArrayList, it was by far the hardest FRQ for me
* Writing class and method. Overall, I am confident in this topic, but I think I could be even better in this topic
